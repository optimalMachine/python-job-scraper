    "There are numerous resources on the internet for finding jobs. As a jobseeker, it is easy to find and search jobs manually through websites such as Indoor, Glassdoor, etc. However, it is somewhat tedious process, and it may take a long time to find a right one. In order to find a job and reduce both time and energy, it is very useful to create a web scraping tool. For this project, Python is the best tool for creating 'Job Scraper'.\n",
    "Here is the process for creating web scrapper for job-seeking purpose.\n",
    "Plus, Python code files will automatically scrap jobs from those two websites."
